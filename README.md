## How to subscribe

Click the following links depending on which calendar app you use.

On iOS/MacOS you can directly sync the calendar against your device, without using iCloud as well. If you 
don't use one of these apps, you can use the Calendar URL directly and "subscribe" to it in your app.

Do not download the ICS file and import it, as that will not keep the calendar updated.

**Note**: A few ticketed events do not yet have their tickets on sale, you will get updates as long as you're subscribed
to the calendar, so keep checking in your calendar app.
